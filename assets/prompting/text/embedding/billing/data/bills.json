    "text": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``National Cancer Act of 2003''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) In 2003, an estimated 1,334,100 Americans will be diagnosed with some form of cancer. (2) In 2003, an estimated 556,500 Americans will die of cancer. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths results from cancer. (3) In 2002, the National Institutes of Health estimated the overall cost of cancer at $171,600,000,000. (4) In 2003, an estimated 211,300 American women and 1,300 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,200 will die of the disease. A mammogram every 1-2 years can reduce the risk of dying by about 16 percent for women 40 years of age and older. (5) In 2003, an estimated 40,100 women will be newly diagnosed with cancer of the uterine corpus and 6,800 women will die of the disease. (6) In 2003, an estimated 147,500 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 57,100 will die of the disease. (7) Incidence rates of colorectal cancer stabilized between 1995 and 1999. Research suggests that declines may be in part due to increased screening and polyp removal. (8) The Chronic Disease Prevention Department found that screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the number of deaths by at least 30 percent. (9) Regular screening examinations by a health care professional can result in early detection of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, prostate, testis, oral cavity, and skin. If all these cancers were diagnosed at a localized stage through regular examinations, the 5-year survival rate would increase from 82 percent to 95 percent. (10) Cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, cervix, esophagus, and pancreas are related to tobacco use. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2003 more than 180,000 cancer deaths will be caused by tobacco use. Smoking alone causes \\1/3\\ of all cancer deaths. (11) More than 1,000,000 skin cancers expected to be diagnosed in 2003 could have been prevented by protection from the sun's rays. (12) An estimated 9,000 new cases of childhood cancer are expected to occur in 2003. (13) Cancer is the chief cause of death by disease in children between the ages of 1 and 14. (14) The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately \\1/3\\ of the 556,500 cancer deaths expected in 2003 will be related to nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity, and other lifestyle factors that could be prevented. (15) About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed at age 55 and older. In order to ensure high quality cancer care for American seniors, medicare reimbursements must reflect the true cost of treatment in every treatment setting and medicare payments should accurately reflect the cost of drug and biologics as well as the cost of administering drugs and supportive care therapies. (16) Despite an aging population, death rates for the most common cancers, lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate continue to drop at an average of 1.7 percent per year. (17) In May 2001, Gleevec, the first in what is expected to be a number of cancer treatments, was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration as it appeared to be effective in stopping the growth of deadly Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cells within 3 months of use. In 2002, Gleevec showed ability to stop growth of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. (18) In early 2003, researchers used gene chips to accurately predict whether or not breast cancer tumors would spread in the future. If the findings are validated, doctors will be able to determine which patients are likely to relapse and need chemotherapy, while sparing those with a favorable prognosis from additional treatment. (19) The Lance Armstrong Foundation, a leading national organization providing services and support for cancer survivors, defines cancer survivorship as living with, through, and beyond cancer. (20) In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the United States. (21) Sixty percent of adults diagnosed with cancer survive at least 5 years. (22) While nearly every childhood cancer diagnosis 20 years ago was fatal, today more than 80 percent of children diagnosed with cancer survive at least 5 years. SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE. It is the sense of the Senate that the United States is at a point in history in which we must take the proper steps to reach the goal of making cancer survivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by the year 2015.

PILOT PROGRAM ON USE OF SERVICE DOGS FOR THE TREATMENT OR REHABILITATION OF VETERANS WITH PHYSICAL OR MENTAL INJURIES OR DISABILITIES. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) The United States owes a profound debt to those who have served the United States honorably in the Armed Forces. (2) Disabled veterans suffer from a range of physical and mental injuries and disabilities. (3) In 2008, the Army reported the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years before 2009. (4) A scientific study documented in the 2008 Rand Report entitled ``Invisible Wounds of War'' estimated that 300,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom currently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. (5) Veterans have benefitted in multiple ways from the provision of service dogs. (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs has been successfully placing guide dogs with the blind since 1961. (7) Thousands of dogs around the country await adoption. (b) Program Required.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall commence a three-year pilot program to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder. (c) Partnerships.-- (1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program by partnering with nonprofit organizations that-- (A) have experience providing service dogs to individuals with injuries or disabilities; (B) do not charge fees for the dogs, services, or lodging that they provide; and (C) are accredited by a generally accepted industry-standard accrediting institution. (2) Reimbursement of costs.--The Secretary shall reimburse partners for costs relating to the pilot program as follows: (A) For the first 50 dogs provided under the pilot program, all costs relating to the provision of such dogs. (B) For dogs provided under the pilot program after the first 50 dogs provided, all costs relating to the provision of every other dog. (d) Participation.-- (1) In general.--As part of the pilot program, the Secretary shall provide a service dog to a number of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities that is greater than or equal to the greater of-- (A) 200; and (B) the minimum number of such veterans required to produce scientifically valid results with respect to assessing the benefits and costs of the use of such dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans. (2) Composition.--The Secretary shall ensure that-- (A) half of the participants in the pilot program are veterans who suffer primarily from a mental health injury or disability; and (B) half of the participants in the pilot program are veterans who suffer primarily from a physical injury or disability. (e) Study.--In carrying out the pilot program, the Secretary shall conduct a scientifically valid research study of the costs and benefits associated with the use of service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities. The matters studied shall include the following: (1) The therapeutic benefits to such veterans, including the quality of life benefits reported by the veterans partaking in the pilot program. (2) The economic benefits of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans, including-- (A) savings on health care costs, including savings relating to reductions in hospitalization and reductions in the use of prescription drugs; and (B) productivity and employment gains for the veterans. (3) The effectiveness of using service dogs to prevent suicide. (f) Reports.-- (1) Annual report of the secretary.--After each year of the pilot program, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the Secretary with respect to the pilot program. (2) Final report by the national academy of sciences.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the completion of the pilot program, the National Academy of Sciences shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the pilot program.",

    "text": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Troop Talent Act of 2013''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for recent veterans of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan was 9.4 percent in February 2013, compared with 7.6 percent in February 2012. (2) With the unemployment rate among such veterans higher than the national average and the number of veterans receiving unemployment benefits doubling since 2002, there is a significant need to assist members of the Armed Forces as they transition to the civilian workforce. (3) In order to remain competitive in the civilian employment market, members of the Armed Forces and veterans require information about how their military skill sets translate to the requirements of the civilian workforce. Members of the Armed Forces currently receive insufficient or inadequate information during their training for military occupational specialties on translating skills obtained during such training to civilian occupations and credentials. (4) In addition, there is a need for enhanced access by accredited credentialing agencies to military training curricula in order to facilitate and enhance the correlation between military training and applicable civilian credentialing courses and exams. (5) The information technology sector is one of the fastest growing industries, with tremendous job growth and demand for talented, qualified individuals. The information technology sector has an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report from February 2013. (6) The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 110,000 computer support specialists over the next decade. Currently, the size of the information technology workforce in the Armed Forces is about 160,000 members. SEC. 3. ENHANCEMENT OF MECHANISMS TO CORRELATE SKILLS AND TRAINING FOR MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES WITH SKILLS AND TRAINING REQUIRED FOR CIVILIAN CERTIFICATIONS AND LICENSES. (a) Improvement of Information Available to Members of the Armed Forces About Correlation.-- (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military departments, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall, to the maximum extent practicable, make information on civilian credentialing opportunities available to members of the Armed Forces beginning with, and at every stage of, training of members for military occupational specialties, in order to permit members-- (A) to evaluate the extent to which such training correlates with the skills and training required in connection with various civilian certifications and licenses; and (B) to assess the suitability of such training for obtaining or pursuing such civilian certifications and licenses. (2) Coordination with transition goals plans success program.--Information shall be made available under paragraph (1) in a manner consistent with the Transition Goals Plans Success (GPS) program. (3) Types of information.--The information made available under paragraph (1) shall include, but not be limited to, the following: (A) Information on the civilian occupational equivalents of military occupational specialties (MOS). (B) Information on civilian license or certification requirements, including examination requirements. (C) Information on the availability and opportunities for use of educational benefits available to members of the Armed Forces, as appropriate, corresponding training, or continuing education that leads to a certification exam in order to provide a pathway to credentialing opportunities. (4) Use and adaptation of certain programs.--In making information available under paragraph (1), the Secretaries of the military departments may use and adapt appropriate portions of the Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) programs of the Army and the Navy and the Credentialing and Educational Research Tool (CERT) of the Air Force. (b) Improvement of Access of Accredited Civilian Credentialing Agencies to Military Training Content.-- (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military departments, in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with national security requirements, make available to accredited civilian credentialing agencies that issue certifications or licenses, upon request of such agencies, information such as military course training curricula, syllabi, and materials, levels of military advancement attained, and professional skills developed. (2) Central repository.--The actions taken pursuant to paragraph (1) may include the establishment of a central repository of information on training and training materials provided members in connection with military occupational specialties that is readily accessible by accredited civilian credentialing agencies described in that paragraph in order to meet requests described in that paragraph.

    "text": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Taxpayer's Right To View Act of 1993''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The Federal Communications Commission predicts a diminished role for broadcast television and a more prominent role for cable television including pay-per-view. (2) Roughly 18,800,000 American homes are equipped to receive pay-per-view and this number is expected to increase to 35,900,000 by 1996. Overall pay-per-view revenue is expected to reach $1,100,000,000 by 1996. (3) There is a growing trend toward making events available exclusively on pay-per-view. (4) As this trend develops, whether the consumer has access to these events will be determined by the ability of the consumer to pay. (5) Professional sports leagues are beginning to see pay- per-view as a new revenue source to keep pace with escalating player salaries. (6) As a result, some media analysts predict that several of broadcast television's premier sports attractions eventually will migrate to pay-per-view. (7) Limited access to viewing such events as the ``Super Bowl'' or ``World Series'' would deprive citizens of the ability to enjoy these events which are inherent in the American tradition. (8) The majority of facilities in which such events are held are funded through taxpayer money. (9) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. (10) Nonprofit and public organizations including public and private educational institutions and their athletic organizations are exempt from the corporate income tax. (11) Furthermore, corporations can deduct their donations to college sporting events as charitable contributions. (12) Tax exempt status is granted to these nonprofit and public organizations by the Federal Government and it is unfair to allow those who use this status to engage in pay-per-view telecasting--thus forcing taxpayers to pay again. (13) It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. (14) Therefore, Congress should ensure that all taxpaying citizens have free access to events that are sponsored by organizations with nonprofit tax exempt status and those events held in taxpayer subsidized facilities. SEC. 3. PAY-PER-VIEW CHARGES PROHIBITED. Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 543) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: ``(i)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a cable operator may not assess or collect any separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support. ``(2) The Commission and local franchising authorities are authorized to make determinations concerning the applicability of the prohibition contained in paragraph (1). In making such determinations-- ``(A) a facility shall be considered to have been constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues if-- ``(i) tax exempt financing was used to construct, maintain, or renovate the facility, ``(ii) the facility was constructed on land donated by a government, or leased by a government at below market rates, or ``(iii) public infrastructure or public service for the facility are provided by the government at below market rates, with the exception of police, fire, and rescue services; ``(B) an event is performed by a nonprofit or public organization that receives tax subsidies if the event is sponsored by, or includes the participation of a team that is a part of, an organization-- ``(i) that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or ``(ii) that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to which donations are tax deductible under such Code; and ``(C) notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a facility shall not be considered to have been constructed with tax revenues if the government has been reimbursed, through the proceeds of a sale of the facility or otherwise, for the total amount of the tax revenues that were used to construct the facility, as determined under subparagraph (A), but in this section shall be construed to exempt facilities from this subsection if the facility is receiving current financial support. ``(3) The Commission shall prescribe, by regulation, procedures for the administration of this subsection.''.",
    "summary": "Taxpayer's Right to View Act of 1993 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a cable operator from assessing separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission and local franchising authorities to make determinations concerning the applicability of such prohibition. Sets forth conditions under which a facility is considered to have been constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues. Considers events performed by nonprofit or public organizations that receive tax subsidies to be subject to this Act if the event is sponsored by, or includes the participation of a team that is part of, a tax exempt organization.",

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PAID BY SYSTEMICALLY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. (a) In General.--Subsection (m) of section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ``(6) Special rule for application to systemically significant financial institutions.-- ``(A) In general.--In the case of an employer which is a systemically significant financial institution, this subsection shall apply with the following modifications: ``(i) Non-public entities.--Paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting `employer' for `publicly held corporation'. ``(ii) Covered employees.--Paragraph (3) shall be applied-- ``(I) by substituting `such employee is among the 25 highest compensated employees' for so much of subparagraph (B) as precedes `for the taxable year (other than the chief executive officer).', and ``(II) in addition to the individuals described in such paragraph (including the individuals described in subclause (I) of this clause), by treating any employee whose actions have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer as a covered employee. Any employee whose applicable employee remuneration for the taxable year exceeds $1,000,000 is presumed to engage in actions which have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer unless the taxpayer submits an information return to the Secretary which describes the role and responsibilities of such employee and the reason such employee should not be considered to have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer. Such return shall be deemed to have been approved unless the Secretary notifies the taxpayer in writing within 90 days of the submission of such return. For purposes of this clause, the term `employee' includes employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1). ``(iii) Remuneration payable on commission basis.--Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) shall not apply. ``(iv) Deferred deduction executive remuneration.--In the case of any deferred deduction executive remuneration (as determined under rules similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(F), if executive remuneration for purposes of such paragraph included remuneration of covered employees as defined in clause (ii) of this paragraph, and if the year in which the applicable services were performed were treated as an applicable taxable year), rules similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(A)(ii) shall apply by substituting `$1,000,000' for `$500,000'. ``(B) Systemically significant financial institution.-- ``(i) In general.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term `systemically significant financial institution' means an entity which engages primarily in activities which are financial in nature (as determined under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956), and which-- ``(I) owns or controls assets greater than $25,000,000,000, or ``(II) owns or controls assets greater than $10,000,000,000 and maintains a ratio of debt to equity which is greater than 20 to 1. ``(ii) Classification.--A taxpayer which is a systemically significant financial institution for any taxable year shall be a systemically significant financial institution for purposes of all subsequent taxable years. ``(C) Special rules for performance-based compensation.--Remuneration payable solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals (hereinafter `performance-based remuneration') which is paid by any systemically significant financial institution to any covered employee (as determined under subparagraph (A)(ii)) shall not be excluded under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) from treatment as applicable employee remuneration unless the following requirements are met: ``(i) Performance-based compensation pool.--The amount and allocation of the taxpayer's performance-based remuneration for covered employees are determined by the compensation committee required under paragraph (4)(C)(i) by taking into account-- ``(I) the cost and quantity of capital required to support the risks taken by the taxpayer in the conduct of the financial activities of the taxpayer, ``(II) the cost and quantity of the liquidity risk assumed by the taxpayer in the conduct of such activities, and ``(III) the timing and likelihood of potential future revenues from such activities. ``(ii) Material terms.--The material terms of performance-based remuneration paid to covered employees specify that-- ``(I) not less than 50 percent of such remuneration must vest no earlier than 5 years after the date of payment, ``(II) the proportion of such remuneration payable under vesting arrangements must increase based on the level of seniority or responsibility of the employee, ``(III) such remuneration payable under vesting arrangements must vest on a basis no faster than pro rata over the specified number of years of such arrangement (not to be less than 5), ``(IV) such remuneration is contingent on a formal agreement between the taxpayer and the employee which forbids the use of personal hedging strategies, remuneration- related insurance, or liability-related insurance which undermines the risk alignment effects of this paragraph, ``(V) in the case of an employer which is a publicly held corporation, not less than 50 percent of such remuneration must be in the form of stock in the employer, and ``(VI) in the case of remuneration paid to a chief executive officer or chief financial officer (if such chief financial officer is a covered employee) of a publicly held corporation, such remuneration must be subject to substantial forfeiture requirements in the event the taxpayer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under Federal securities laws. For purposes of this clause, the date on which remuneration is deemed to have vested is the first date on which such remuneration is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of section 409A(d)(4)). ``(D) Special rule for performance-based compensation paid by non-public entities.--In the case of a systemically significant financial institution which is not a publicly held corporation, in addition to the requirements of subparagraph (C), paragraph (4)(C) shall be applied by substituting the following for clauses (i) through (iii) thereof: ``(i) the taxpayer commissions an annual, external review of its compensation policies and practices, including an examination and analysis of the taxpayer's compliance with the requirements of this subsection, and ``(ii) the taxpayer obtains certification from an unrelated third party commissioned to evaluated compensation practices that performance goals and other material terms under which the remuneration is to be paid are satisfied before any payment of such remuneration is made.'. For purposes of the preceding sentence, all persons treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 or subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 shall be treated as related taxpayers. ``(E) Coordination with rules for employers participating in the troubled assets relief program.-- In the case of any systemically significant financial institution to which paragraph (5) applies for any taxable year, this paragraph shall not apply to any payment of remuneration to which such paragraph applies. ``(F) Regulatory authority.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall prescribe such guidance, rules, or regulations of general applicability as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this paragraph, including-- ``(i) the method for valuing assets for purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), ``(ii) the method for calculating the ratio described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II), ``(iii) criteria for use in determining whether the actions of an employee have a material impact on the risk exposure of the taxpayer, and for determining what constitutes a substantial forfeiture requirement with respect to executive remuneration, ``(iv) criteria for determining whether a remuneration agreement constitutes a hedging strategy, and ``(v) anti-abuse rules to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this paragraph, including by use of independent contractors. ``(G) Application of paragraph.--This paragraph shall apply-- ``(i) in the case of an entity which is a systemically significant financial institution in calendar 2010, to remuneration for services performed in calendar years beginning after 2010, and ``(ii) in the case of an entity which becomes a systemically significant financial institution in a calender year after 2010, to remuneration for services performed in calendar years beginning with the second calendar year after the year in which such entity first becomes a systemically significant financial institution.''. (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subparagraph (G) of section 162(m)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Paragraph (6) shall not apply to any payment of remuneration to which this paragraph applies.''. (c) Report on Performance-Based Compensation Paid by Publicly Held Corporations.-- (1) In general.--Each systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation shall submit to the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and shall make publicly available, an annual report on compensation policies and practices which describes-- (A) the process used to develop and modify such institution's compensation policies, including the composition and the mandate of such institution's compensation committee, (B) the actions taken by such institution to comply with section 162(m)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (C) any additional actions taken to implement the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices adopted by the Financial Stability Board established by the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, (D) the most important design characteristics of such institution's compensation policies, including criteria used for performance measurement and risk adjustment, the linkage between pay and performance, vesting policy and criteria, and the parameters used for allocating cash versus other forms of remuneration, (E) aggregate quantitative information on remuneration paid by such institution, differentiating between remuneration paid to senior executive officers and to employees whose actions have a material impact on the risk exposure of such institution, which indicates the amounts of remuneration for the financial year (divided into fixed and variable remuneration) and the number of employees to which such remuneration was paid, and (F) the amount of remuneration paid by such institution during the financial year preceding the year of the report which was nondeductible by reason of section 162(m) of such Code. (2) Timing of report.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall be submitted beginning in calendar year 2011 (or, if later, the calendar year after the year in which an entity first becomes a systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation), at such time during such year and each subsequent year as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission shall specify. (3) Definitions.--Any term used in this subsection which is also used in section 162(m)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall have the same meaning as when used in such section. (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) shall apply to remuneration for services performed after December 31, 2010.",
    "summary": "Wall Street Compensation Reform Act of 2010 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to restrict the tax deduction for compensation paid to highly-paid employees of systemically significant financial institutions. Requires such compensation to be performance-based, to vest no earlier than five years after the date of payment, and to consist of 50 employer stock. Prohibits such highly-paid employees from using personal hedging strategies and remuneration or liability-related insurance and requires forfeiture of compensation paid to a chief executive or financial officer of such an institution if an accounting restatement is required due to material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any federal financial reporting requirement. Defines a systemically significant financial institution as an entity which engages primarily in financial activities and which: (1) owns or controls assets greater than $25 billion. Or (2) owns or controls assets greater than $10 billion and maintains a ratio of debt to equity greater than 20 to 1. Requires each systemically significant financial institution which is a publicly held corporation to make an annual report on its compensation policies and practices to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and make such report publicly available.",

    "text": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) is to maintain marine mammal species and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations. (2) If the annual removals of individuals of a species or population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential biological removal level, the species or population stock will be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population. (3) Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable population and penalizes commercial fishermen. (4) The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best technology that is economically and technologically feasible. (5) Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of endangered species and threatened species through predation or competition in the ecosystem. (6) The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal. (7) All persons that interact with marine mammals should seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and mortalities through the use of the best equipment and techniques that are economically and technologically feasible. SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF GOALS FOR REDUCING INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MARINE MAMMALS IN COMMERCIAL FISHING. (a) Repeal of Zero Mortality Goal.--Section 118 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1387) is amended by striking subsection (b), and by redesignating subsections (c) through (l) in order as subsections (b) through (k). (b) Conforming Amendments.--Such Act is further amended as follows: (1) In section 101(a)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)) by striking the third sentence. (2) In section 101(a)(5)(E)(i)(III) (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5)(E)(i)(III) by striking ``subsection (d)'' and inserting ``subsection (c)''. (3) In section 115(b)(4) (16 U.S.C. 1384(b)(4)) by striking ``section 118(f)(1)'' and inserting ``section 118(e)(1)''. (4) In section 117(a)(4) (16 U.S.C. 1386(a)(4)) in subparagraph (D) by striking ``, and an analysis'' and all that follows through the end of the subparagraph and inserting a semicolon. (5) In section 118 (16 U.S.C. 1387) by striking ``subsection (c)(1)(A) (i)'' each place it appears and inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)''. (6) In section 118 (16 U.S.C. 1387) by striking ``subsection (c)(1)(A)(i)'' each place it appears and inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(i)''. (7) In section 118(a)(1) (16 U.S.C. 1387(a)(1)) by striking the last sentence. (8) In section 118(b), as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section 16 U.S.C. 1387(c)(1)(B)), by striking ``subsection (e)'' each place it appears and inserting ``subsection (d)''. (9) In section 118(c)(1)(B), as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(d)(1)(B)), by striking ``subsection (e)'' and inserting ``subsection (d)''. (10) In section 118(e)(9)(D), as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(f)(9)(D)), by striking ``subsection (d)'' and inserting ``subsection (c)''. (11) In section 118(f)(1), as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(g)(1)), by striking ``subsection (c)(1)(A)(iii)'' each place it appears and inserting ``subsection (b)(1)(A)(iii)''. (12) In section 118(g), as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(h)), by striking ``subsection (c)'' and inserting ``subsection (b)''. (13) In section 120(j)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1389(j)(2)) by striking ``118(f)(5)(A)'' and inserting ``118(e)(5)(A)''. (c) Modification of Goal of Take Reduction Plans.--Section 118(e)(2) of such Act, as redesignated by subsection (a) of this section (16 U.S.C. 1387(f)(2)), is amended by striking the last sentence and inserting the following: ``The long-term goal of the plan shall be to reduce, within 5 years after its implementation, the incidental mortality or serious injury of marine mammals incidentally taken in the course of fishing operations taking into account the economics of the fishery, the availability of existing technology, and existing State or regional fishery management plans.''.",
    "summary": "Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to repeal the long-term goal of reducing to zero the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations. Makes reduction of such incidental mortality and serious injury the long-term goal.",

    "text": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act''. SEC. 2. CONSUMER RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLOSED ACCOUNTS. The Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by striking section 262 and inserting the following: ``SEC. 262. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that-- ``(1) economic stability would be enhanced, competition between depository institutions would be improved, and the ability of the consumer to make informed decisions regarding deposit accounts, and to verify accounts, would be strengthened if there were uniformity in the disclosure of terms and conditions on which interest is paid and fees are assessed in connection with such accounts; and ``(2) consumers lack meaningful choices for managing household funds because-- ``(A) despite dissatisfaction with rising account fees at some depository institutions, consumers often find it too difficult to move their funds to new deposit accounts; ``(B) the process of moving funds to new deposit accounts often involves several steps and substantial time to complete, and it is not always clear what the proper procedures are for closing an account at a given depository institution; ``(C) depository institutions have no obligation and may lack the technical capabilities to help consumers transfer automated deposits or debits from old accounts to new accounts, causing delays and confusion; ``(D) depository institutions may charge fees to close an account and withdraw available funds, which can impede banking mobility for low-income consumers; and ``(E) some depository institutions have engaged in the practice of reopening closed accounts without the consent of the consumer. ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are-- ``(1) to allow consumers to make a meaningful comparison between competing claims of depository institutions with regard to deposit accounts by requiring the clear and uniform disclosure of-- ``(A) the rates of interest that are payable on deposit accounts by depository institutions; and ``(B) the fees that are assessable against deposit accounts; and ``(2) to protect rights of consumers by providing a framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of depository institutions and consumers in closing procedures for certain types of consumer deposit accounts.''; (2) by inserting after section 268 the following: ``SEC. 268A. CLOSURE OF COVERED ACCOUNTS. ``(a) In General.--A depository institution may not-- ``(1) prohibit a consumer from closing a covered account at the depository institution, regardless of whether the balance in the covered account is positive, zero, or negative; ``(2) charge any fee to close a covered account; or ``(3) reopen a covered account that a consumer has requested to be closed in accordance with this section to apply subsequent debits, whether preauthorized or otherwise, or for any other reason, unless the consumer expressly requests that the covered account be reopened. ``(b) Disclosures Required.--A depository institution shall provide to any consumer that opens a covered account at the depository institution a description of the policies and procedures that the depository institution has in place to close a covered account-- ``(1) at the time the consumer opens the covered account; ``(2) at any time, upon request of a consumer; and ``(3) on the website of the depository institution. ``(c) Regulations Relating to Closure of Covered Accounts.-- ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, the Bureau, after consultation with each agency referred to in section 270(a), and public notice and opportunity for comment, shall prescribe final regulations to carry out this section. ``(2) Content.--The regulations required by this subsection shall-- ``(A) require that a depository institution close a covered account not later than 5 business days after the date on which a consumer makes a request to close the covered account, except that the closure of the covered account may be delayed-- ``(i) if a Federal or State law enforcement agency notifies the depository institution that the closure will interfere with a criminal investigation; or ``(ii) pursuant to any other exception that the Bureau determines is appropriate; ``(B) prescribe the methods by which a consumer may make a request to a depository institution to close a covered account, which, except as provided in subparagraph (C), shall include requests made in person, over the phone, or by other electronic or remote means; ``(C) allow a depository institution to require that a request by a consumer to close a covered account shall be made in person if the covered account contains an amount on deposit exceeding a certain monetary threshold, as determined and established by the Bureau; ``(D) establish procedures that require a depository institution to positively verify the identity of a consumer requesting to close a covered account before the depository institution closes the covered account, including procedures for a depository institution to follow if the depository institution is unable to verify the identity of the consumer; ``(E) establish procedures for a depository institution to provide a consumer with the funds contained in a covered account that the consumer has requested to close, which shall include procedures-- ``(i) that ensure that the consumer whose identity has been positively verified by the depository institution has access to any funds available for withdrawal at the time the consumer makes a request to the depository institution to close the covered account; ``(ii) that establish a reasonable amount of time for the depository institution to remit to the consumer the remainder of any funds in the closed covered account, including funds that are subject to a dispute between the depository institution and the consumer; and ``(iii) that allow a consumer whose identity has been positively verified by the depository institution to receive available funds from a covered account that the consumer has requested to close in the form of-- ``(I) a cashier's check provided to the consumer; ``(II) an electronic funds transfer to an account designated by the consumer; ``(III) any means offered by the depository institution that the consumer has requested; or ``(IV) any means that the Bureau determines appropriate;

    "summary": "Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act - Amends the Truth in Savings Act to prohibit depository institutions from: (1) prohibiting a consumer from closing a covered account , regardless of whether the balance is positive, zero, or negative, (2) charging any fee to close such account. Or (3) reopening such an account to apply subsequent debits after a consumer has requested the account to be closed, unless the consumer requests that the account be reopened. Requires depository institutions to provide consumers with a description of the policies and procedures in place to close such accounts at the time the account is opened, upon request, and on the websites of such institutions. Directs the CFPB to prescribe regulations relating to the closure of such accounts, including: (1) allowing consumers to receive available funds from a closed account in the form of a cashier's check, electronic funds transfer, or any other means offered by the institution or determined appropriate by the CFPB. (2) requiring depository institutions to provide consumers with certain information regarding any preauthorized transactions or direct deposits associated with an account before it is closed. (3) prohibiting a depository institution from reporting adverse information regarding such account to any consumer reporting agency if, at the time the account is closed, the account has a negative balance resulting solely from any fee assessed by the depository institution. And (4) establishing the terms under which a depository institution may report to a consumer reporting agency that an account had a negative closing balance, provided that the institution notifies the consumer and provides a reasonable period for repayment of the balance. Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to report to Congress and the CFPB regarding additional barriers that could limit the ability of a consumer to close a covered account. Requires the CFPB, after receiving such report, to determine whether regulations should be issued to remove such barriers.",

    "text": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Education and Training for Health Act of 2017'' or the ``EAT for Health Act of 2017''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) According to 2013 national health expenditure data, United States health care spending increased 3.6 percent to reach $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person, and accounted for 17.4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). (2) According to the Institute of Medicine, in 2012 estimates of health care costs attributed over 75 percent of national health expenditures to treatment for chronic diseases. (3) A March 2003 report from the World Health Organization concluded diet was a major cause of chronic diseases. (4) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the United States each year are from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. (5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 heart disease was the leading cause of death for American adults. Approximately 600,000 American adults die each year from cardiovascular disease. Coronary heart disease alone costs American taxpayers $108.9 billion each year. (6) Research has shown that following a healthful diet can not only reduce symptoms related to cardiovascular disease but can also actually reverse damage done to the arteries. (7) According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, two-thirds of adults in the United States are currently overweight, and half of those overweight individuals are obese. One in three children are overweight, and one-fifth of children are obese. The United States spends about $147 to $210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis. (8) An estimated 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes. Another 86 million American adults have prediabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that one in three children born in 2000 will develop diabetes at some point in their lives. Total estimated costs of diagnosed diabetes have increased 41 percent, to $245 billion in 2012 from $174 billion in 2007. (9) According to the American Cancer Society, there will be an estimated 1,658,370 new cancer cases diagnosed and 589,430 cancer deaths in the United States in 2015. That is equivalent to about 1,620 deaths per day and accounts for nearly 1 of every 4 deaths. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) estimates that the direct medical costs for cancer in the United States in 2011 were $88.7 billion. (10) According to the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, in 2008 physicians felt inadequately trained to provide proper nutrition advice. Ninety-four percent felt nutrition counseling should be included during primary care visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to provide such counseling. (11) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences report recommended that all medical schools require at least 25 contact hours of nutrition education. According to a 2009 national survey of medical colleges published in Academic Medicine, only 38 percent of medical schools met these minimum standards by requiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of their general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that number had shrunk to 27 percent. In addition, 30 percent of United States medical schools required a dedicated nutrition course in 2004. Most recently, only 25 percent of such schools required such a course in 2010. (12) According to the Journal of Nutrition in Clinical Practice in 2010, more than half of graduating medical students felt their nutrition education was insufficient. (13) Recognizing the importance of nutrition, Healthy People 2020--the Federal Government's framework for a healthier Nation--includes a goal (NWS-6) to increase the proportion of physician office visits that include counseling or education related to nutrition or weight. According to Healthy People 2020, only 13.8 percent of physician office visits included counseling about nutrition or diet (2010 latest year available). (14) According to Mission: Readiness, one in four Americans cannot serve in the military due to weight. For those serving, the military discharged 4,300 active-duty personnel due to weight problems in 2012. (15) According to the Journal of American Health Promotion, the military spends well over $1 billion a year to treat weight-related health problems such as heart disease and diabetes through its TRICARE health insurance for active duty personnel, reservists, retirees and their families. (16) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults are 60 percent more likely to be obese and over twice as likely as to have diabetes compared to White adults. (17) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Indian or Alaska Native adults have the highest rate of diabetes among all minority groups at 15.9 percent. SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES GUIDELINES, AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ANNUAL REPORTS, RELATING TO CERTAIN PRIMARY CARE FEDERAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS COMPLETING CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION ON NUTRITION. (a) Guidelines.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue guidelines to Federal agencies for developing procedures and requirements to ensure that every primary care health professional employed full-time for such agencies have continuing education courses relating to nutrition (as described in subsection (c)).

If the agency, with respect to such previous year, did not fully adopt and encourage such guidelines with respect to such professionals, the head of the agency shall include in the report for the year the percentage of such professionals employed by such agency to furnish primary care services who completed continuing education courses relating to nutrition (as described in subsection (c)). (c) Continuing Education Relating to Nutrition.--For purposes of subsections (a) and (b), continuing education courses relating to nutrition shall include at least content on the role of nutrition in the prevention, management, and, as possible, reversal of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act: (1) Continuing education.--The term ``continuing education'' is defined as courses that meet requirements for Continuing Medical Education (CME) or Continuing Education (CE) by medical or nurse practitioner professional organizations or certified accrediting bodies. (2) Nurse practitioner.--The term ``nurse practitioner'' has the meaning given such term in section 1861(aa)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(5)). (3) Physician.--The term ``physician'' has the meaning given such term in section 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(1)). (4) Primary care health professional.--The term ``primary care health professional'' means a physician or nurse practitioner who furnishes primary care services. (5) Primary care services.--The term ``primary care services'' has the meaning given such term in section 1842(i)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(i)(4)), but shall include such services furnished by a nurse practitioner as would otherwise be included if furnished by a physician.",
