Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some water boiling.
While that's happening, grab a cup and put a tea bag in it.
Once the water is hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag.
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep.
After a few minutes, take out the tea bag.
If you like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste.
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious cup of tea to enjoy.
